# ⑤ Apply OpenSpy patches

OpenSpy is an open-source GameSpy clone which aims to provide 100% compatibility with GameSpy games. Reclamation is the core BF2142 community that utilises the OpenSpy master server.

Apart from Openspy - Reclamation, there are other master servers and communities as well. To name a few, we have NovGames, PlayBF2142 and MAGMA. OpenSpy - Reclamation, however, offers the most long-lasting and stable service with a large and active community for support. In this tutorial, we will focus on getting our game to work with OpenSpy.

A master server is a server that holds the database of your login credentials and soldier data. It broadcasts[^1] game servers to the server browser, while in return a game server regularly reports the player's in-game progress to the master server.

Installing OpenSpy patches to the game forces the game to connect through OpenSpy instead of the dead GameSpy. This allows the game to work again, especially for the login and online part, after [GameSpy shutdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy#Shutdown) in June 2014.

## Installing the Reclamation Map Pack

The Reclamation Community operates 2 multiplayer servers, with both running their modified version of maps. In order to play on their public servers, you will have to install their map pack or the map that the server is currently running on.

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps are optional as they are only required if you want to play on Reclamation's multiplayer servers.
{% endhint %}

**Installing the complete pack**

1. Under the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, double-click on <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 MapPack v1.0</mark>. The app will then open up your browser and navigate to the download link of the pack. Download <mark style="color:blue;">2142\_MapPack\_v1.zip</mark> ([bf2142.ddns.net](http://bf2142.ddns.net/), 3.9GB).
2. Once the download is completed, click the <mark style="color:blue;">MapPack Installer \*</mark> button and select the downloaded .zip file.
3. A command-line window will pop up. The window will be closed once the installation is completed.
4. If everything looks good, close the app.

**Installing individual maps**

There is an option to download the maps individually. To do so, you may refer to the following instructions:

1. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, click <mark style="color:blue;">Individual Maps</mark>.&#x20;
2. Select the maps that you want to download from the <mark style="color:blue;">Available Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;">>></mark>.&#x20;
3. To uninstall a map, select the map from the <mark style="color:blue;">Installed Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;"><<</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reclamation servers are [unmodded servers](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], but are run on a set of modified maps. The downloaded maps are installed to the <mark style="color:blue;">/mods/bf2142/Levels</mark> folder.
{% endhint %}

To explore and switch between different master servers, it is better to use [BF2142 Unlocker](../enhancements/bf2142unlocker.md). But let's stick with OpenSpy at the moment until we get a more thorough understanding of how the game works.

[^1]: A master server makes a game server visible on the client's server browser.

[^2]: i.e., vanilla servers
