# ④ Install ​BF2142 Hub

BF2142 Hub is a handy tool that provides a click-to-go method to install OpenSpy and NovGames patches. You will need these custom patches to pass through the login page, find servers from the server browser, and play online. This has something to do with the existence of master servers, which will be discussed in detail in the [next tutorial](5.-installing-openspy-patches.md).

The tool is developed and maintained by the [Reclamation Team](https://battlefield2142.co/). You are encouraged to join their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/MEwBW9U) to receive the latest updates about their project.
