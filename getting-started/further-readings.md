The Project Remaster's manual includes a lot of important information about the game and the mod itself, so we strongly recommend taking the time to read through their materials.

The manual is an excellent resource for you to dig deeper about the game. The manual itself is a built-in component of the mod, which means all you have to do is to [install the Project Remaster mod](3.-installing-project-remaster.md) and click the <mark style="color:blue;">Manual</mark> button in the launcher to launch the offline wiki.
